# My Mandala Art Using Turtle Graphics 🌻🌹🌷
## "Petals of Pleasures"

 The design and idea of my mandala is inspired from a dream catcher. I’ve named it as “Petals of Pleasure” as it is made up of 3 kinds of flowers which symbolize human pleasures, namely; dahlia flower which can be seen in the very middle of the mandala. Dahlia flower symbolize wealth and elegance. Followed by petals of rose which symbolize love and romance, and a sunflower which represents happiness. Every pattern of my mandala is created with the use of circles, in art it represents equality and unity. So, the main idea of this mandala is to promote unity of 3 pleasures in life which are wealth, love, and happiness with good intentions to have a quality life.
